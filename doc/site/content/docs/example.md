## Reading notes {#reading-notes}

I use `reno` to add some reading notes:

From this marked PDF Document:

{{< figure src="/market-text-example.png" >}}

i get (after some edits) this org-mode snippet:

{{< figure src="/market-text-example-notes-org.png" >}}

where i can

-   change some quotes to headers
-   edit exported text
-   add some notes for me


## Play with code {#play-with-code}

I can mark some challenges:

{{< figure src="/market-challenges.png" >}}

include some org-babel source blocks to solve the challenges:

{{< figure src="/market-challenges-notes-org.png" >}}

and export it from Emacs as Pdf to read it later again:

{{< figure src="/market-challenges-notes-pdf.png" >}}
